This is the repository for the [portfolio](http://bravodavid56.github.io).

This site uses __Angular 2__ themed with __Angular Material Design__.

The different tabs correspond to different injected directives, whose views are kept in the /views folder. This portfolio did not have much of a need for a controller, other than getting the theme's colors and setting them as scope variables.

The portfolio is intentionally simple so as not to overwhelm the viewer. Simply put, a portfolio is supposed to showcase a person's work, and I think it achieves this most efficiently with simplicity.
